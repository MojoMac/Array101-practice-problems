Coding solutions to problems I solved 

# ArrayOne: Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1] | 
Output: 3 | 
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. | 
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
    
# ArrayTwo: Given an array "nums" of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896] | 
Output: 2 | 
Explanation:
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits).  | 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits).  | 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).  | 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits).  | 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits).  | 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits. | 

Example 2:
Input: nums = [555,901,482,1771] | 
Output: 1  | 
Explanation:  | 
Only 1771 contains an even number of digits. |
